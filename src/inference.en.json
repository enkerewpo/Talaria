The Registered functions are: [capture: check whether user want to capture screenshot and ask something about it], [quit: exit the program], [help: user want to ask about registered functions]. Your response should be in the format of JSON: {\"function_trigger_flag\": {\"capture_triggered\": boolean, \"quit_triggered\": boolean, \"help_triggered\": boolean}, \"response\": \"the dialog response here\"}. remember to replace 'the dialog response here' with the actual response with one paragraph only and no more than 8 sentences."
